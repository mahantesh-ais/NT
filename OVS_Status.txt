Current status of OVS is as below:
* most of core work is done: dom0 gets an IP addr on start/reboot,
                             bridges are set as and when required with the help of udev script /etc/xen/scripts/vif in ndvm
			     adding of bridges is triggered through xl, for guests its written into config file as to what nics are to be added on start/reboot
			     for dom0 its triggered through /etc/xen/scripts/network && /etc/xen/scripts/nw-attach, the former is triggered through editing the config file of ndvm (run-on-state-change), later is triggered by former.
			     when ndvm is rebooted while some guests are still running:
			     on ndvm state change to running, xenmgr re-attaches(detach-attach) any of the vifs related to each guests (ovs is not yet initialized at this moment in ndvm, currently I wait in a loop for it to be initialized before proceeding with bridge creation
			     . This is not a good idea, the optimization is to wait for a signal from ovs init script to be sent to waiting processes and the waiting processes here being udev triggered vif script. This will require some sort of synchronization among
			     the waiting processes hint:)

* UI work(toolstack-data): modified code to show different Network options while guest creation. This is currently done with hard coded values as opposed to dynamic updates with the help of network-daemon and network-slave.
                           Currently working with Network Menu icon, as of now it is able to establish Web-socket and hence DBus connection via rpc-broker in ndvm. But, on sending a signal (viptables -F and then click on Network) rpc-broker (port 8080) dies off with segfault.
			   This is to be investigated with the help of gdb: nr, rw, opkg update, opkg install gdb, ro -> do these in dom0 to find what ipk's are installed. Then copy those ipk's from build machine to dom0 and then to ndvm (using scpv4v)
			   in ndvm do opkg install path-to-ipks. Also copy dbg package ipk of rpc-broker into ndvm and install it (this is for debug symbols which will be used by gdb).
			   The above requires changing ndvm to rw, refer relevant document.
			   Note: Refer to ui debugging file to debug javascript in the surf browser.

rpc broker and ovs work is merged, the latest build is #1797.
