             block tap --> userspace toolkit for disk io interface




	1. blktap kernel driver in Dom0
	2. blkfront instance of the driver in DomU
	3. XenBus connecting blktap and blktfront

	Additionally blktap has the following components in Dom0
	1. /dev/blktap0 --a character device in Dom0
	2. /dev/xen/blktapX -X is the number representing the virtual disk.
	3. blktapctrl --userspace daemon responsible for creation of new virtual disks.
	4. tapdisk --a process associated with every virtual disk and is spawned by blktapctrl and responsible for handling all the io requests to that virtual disk associated.
	5.named pipes or fifo created to communicate between blktapctrl and tapdisk. 
	6.fe_ring(frontend ring) requests from domUs are mapped to the tapdisk process handling the io for that virtual disk using the fe_ring. 

	blktapctrl is started along with xend.
