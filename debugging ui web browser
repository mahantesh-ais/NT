Debugging ui (in machine web browser):

1. This first step requires uivm to be mounted as rw (edit the template, restart dbd and reboot uivm)
   the webinspector-XX.ipk is built but not installed by default.
   copy it from the build machine into uivm and install it.
   Now edit the .config/xfce*/xinitrc and edit the surf launch options in it.
   The options should be: -BdFgkNP (for more info see man pages of surf).
   reboot uivm

    OR 

   edit the bitbake file xenclient-uivm-image.bb and include the webkit-gtk-webinspector package in the install list
   and give a build with that. Also, its required to change the options for surf to start. Edit the xinitrc file that will be installed in
   uivm and find surf launch and edit the options to be the following: -BdFgkNP (for more info see man pages for surf)

  * options to launch surf have webinspector and plugins disabled by default, the main reason to change the options above is to enable
    them.

2. press ctrl+shift+o 

3. go to scripts section and enable debugging
